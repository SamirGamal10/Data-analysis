# 📈 Advertising Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction

## 📝 Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether a user will click on an advertisement based on their demographics and online behavior. Using a **Decision Tree Classifier**, we analyze factors like income, age, and daily internet usage to optimize marketing strategies.

## 📊 Dataset Insights
The dataset contains 1000 entries with 10 features. Key findings from EDA:
* **Target Balance:** The dataset is perfectly balanced (500 clicks vs 500 non-clicks).
* **Key Factors:** Users with lower daily internet usage and lower daily time spent on the site are more likely to click the ads.
* **Demographics:** There is a noticeable correlation between age and the probability of clicking.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
